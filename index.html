        <h1>REFLECTIVE DOCUMENTATION</h1>
        <P>In the course of my learning journey from the <b>ALT SCHOOL</b> <i>Learnng Management System</i>, my knowlegde was
             broadened on what Software Engineering entails as i was taken down further to learning about the <strong>Hyper-text Mark-up Language</strong>,
            it's Documentation structure, the Elements and attributes like the " span and img tag". <br> I also got acqauinted with how to add audio and video to my site (this was quite fun!üëç)
                the 'h' elements that was used to input diferent font sizes for our headings were a delight.
            </P>
            <p>
                Using the <b>Cascading Style Sheet</b>(CSS), to add styles to our documents made it more beautiful and understanding for the users as well as drew them to the beauty of the website,
                ability to apply colors to either the background or even implement transitions to our work raised the site from a 0 to 10.
                <br> This skill opened up my mind to what beauty we could create when we set our mind to it and how these can serve as tools to create change, make impact , solve human problems  and make lives easier.
